# JSON Description

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange
format. It is easy for humans to read and write. It is easy for machines
to parse and generate. JSON is common data formats used to receive data
from a web server. JSON is built on two structures: 1. A collection of
name/value pairs. 2. An ordered list of values.

# Pros/Cons of Packages

We chose the `jsonlite` package to read in our data \[@jsonlite\]. The
`rjson` package was also considered, but inital attempts performed
slowly and needed extra code to implement the data into a dataframe
\[@rjson\]. The `jsonlite` package converts read data directly into a
dataframes by default, while `rjson` will convert data into a list by
default. Given our need to work with large data sets and to create
dataframes, `jsonlite` performs better for our needs.

# Data

This data we are using is the NHL records, an jsonlite API is used to
retrieve all the team data (including the details about team New Jersey
Devils).

## Read the data

``` r
# Read in data from JSON source

root_url <- 'https://records.nhl.com/site/api'
json_file <- (paste0(root_url,'/franchise'))
source_data <- fromJSON(json_file)
franchise_df <- as.data.frame(source_data$data) #Convert to data frame

json_file <- (paste0(root_url,'/franchise-team-totals'))
source_data <- fromJSON(json_file)
franchise_team_total <- as.data.frame(source_data$data) #Convert to data frame
franchise_team_total$gameTypeId <- as.factor(franchise_team_total$gameTypeId)


franchise_id=23
json_file <- (paste0(root_url,'/franchise-season-records?cayenneExp=franchiseId=',franchise_id))
source_data <- fromJSON(json_file)
franchise_team_season <- as.data.frame(source_data$data) #Convert to data frame


json_file <- (paste0(root_url,'/franchise-goalie-records?cayenneExp=franchiseId=',franchise_id))
source_data <- fromJSON(json_file)
franchise_team_goalie <- as.data.frame(source_data$data) #Convert to data frame

json_file <- (paste0(root_url,'/franchise-skater-records?cayenneExp=franchiseId=',franchise_id))
source_data <- fromJSON(json_file)
franchise_team_skater <- as.data.frame(source_data$data) #Convert to data frame
```

## Basic data exploratory

A basic exploratory data analysis. + The scatterplot between losses and
home losses shows a very good linear relationship + The linear
relationship between losses and home losses still hold within each game
type.

``` r
ggplot(franchise_team_total,aes(losses,homeLosses)) +
  geom_point()
```

![](Project1_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png)<!-- -->

``` r
ggplot(franchise_team_total,aes(losses,homeLosses)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_grid(cols=vars(gameTypeId),scales = "free",labeller = label_both)
```

![](Project1_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-2-2.png)<!-- -->

**Take the** *franchiseId=23* **an an example, the scatterplot between
most wins in one season and total wins for each team member shows some
linear relationship and this relationship is better when the outlier was
excluded.**

``` r
plot(franchise_team_goalie$mostWinsOneSeason, franchise_team_goalie$wins, main='Relationshio between most wins in one season\n v.s. wins for each member')
```

![](Project1_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png)<!-- -->

``` r
plot(franchise_team_goalie$mostWinsOneSeason[-1], franchise_team_goalie$wins[-1], main='Relationshio between most wins in one season\n v.s. wins for each member (exclude outlier)')
```

## Create Contingency Table

**Show contingency table with columns of team and game type (summarise
the total of wins)**

``` r
#Function creates Contingency Table
contingencyTable<-franchise_team_total %>% group_by_at(c('teamName','gameTypeId')) %>% 
    summarise(wins = sum(wins)) %>% 
    spread(key = 'gameTypeId', value = "wins")

kable(contingencyTable)
```

## Histogram plot by side by side

**Plot the histogram of the wins by game
type**

``` r
franchise_by_gametype<-franchise_team_total %>% group_by_at(c('teamName','teamId','gameTypeId')) %>% 
    summarise(wins = sum(wins), losses=sum(losses))

ggplot(franchise_by_gametype,aes(gameTypeId,wins)) +
  geom_col() 
```

![](Project1_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png)<!-- -->

**Plot the histogram of the wins for each team (side by side with game
type)**, *It shows that when the wins in game type=2 is high, the wins
in game type=2 is also high.*

``` r
ggplot(franchise_by_gametype,aes(teamId,wins,gameTypeId)) +
  geom_col() +
  facet_grid(rows=vars(gameTypeId), labeller = label_both,scales = "free",)
```

![](Project1_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png)<!-- -->

## Box plot side by side

**The box plot for wins within the game type.** + We can see that the
median for the game type=2 is around 650 with no outliers + The median
for the game type=3 is around 70 with two outliers

``` r
ggplot(franchise_team_total,aes(gameTypeId,wins)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  facet_grid(rows=vars(gameTypeId), labeller = label_both,scales = "free" )
```

# Create new variables

**Create new variable** + Over all win percent (winPercent) + Win
percent at home (homewinPercent) + Scatter plot the win percent v.s.
home win percent, the result shows strong linear relationship with more
outliers than the scatter plot of wins v.s. homewins.

``` r
#Create new variables of home win percentage and win percentage
franchise_team_percentage<-franchise_team_total %>% replace_na(list(wins= 0, ties = 0, losses=0, homeWins=0, homeLosses=0, homeTies=0)) %>%
  mutate(winPercent=wins/(wins+ties+losses),homewinPercent=homeWins/(homeWins+homeTies+homeLosses)) 

ggplot(data=franchise_team_percentage,aes(winPercent,homewinPercent)) +
  geom_point()
```
